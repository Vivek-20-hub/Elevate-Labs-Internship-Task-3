### üìå CREATE Indexes:

**Index of user_id:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX UserID_index ON cleaned_people_data(user_id);
```

**Index of sex:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX Sex_index ON cleaned_people_data(sex);
```

### üìä Created Views:

**1. Average Birth Year**
```sql
CREATE VIEW AvgBirthYear AS
SELECT AVG(CAST(strftime('%Y', date_of_birth) AS INTEGER)) AS avg_birth_year FROM cleaned_people_data;
```

**2. Count By Gender**
```sql
CREATE VIEW CountByGender AS
SELECT sex, COUNT(*) AS total FROM cleaned_people_data GROUP BY sex;
```

**3. Job Title Stats**
```sql
CREATE VIEW JobTitleStats AS
SELECT job_title, COUNT(*) AS count FROM cleaned_people_data GROUP BY job_title ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### üîç Output Views

```sql
SELECT * FROM AvgBirthYear;
SELECT * FROM CountByGender;
SELECT * FROM JobTitleStats;
```

---

### üë∂ People Born After 2000

```sql
SELECT user_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth
FROM cleaned_people_data
WHERE date_of_birth > '2000-01-01'
ORDER BY date_of_birth DESC;
```

---

### üßì People Older Than Average (Subquery)

```sql
SELECT user_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth
FROM cleaned_people_data
WHERE CAST(strftime('%Y', date_of_birth) AS INTEGER) < (
    SELECT AVG(CAST(strftime('%Y', date_of_birth) AS INTEGER)) FROM cleaned_people_data
);
```

---

### ü§ù Inner Join: People with Same Job Title

```sql
SELECT a.user_id AS user1_id, b.user_id AS user2_id, a.job_title
FROM cleaned_people_data a
JOIN cleaned_people_data b ON a.job_title = b.job_title
WHERE a.user_id <> b.user_id;
```

---

### üß¨ Left Join: Same Gender Users

```sql
SELECT a.user_id, a.first_name, b.user_id AS matched_user, a.sex
FROM cleaned_people_data a
LEFT JOIN cleaned_people_data b ON a.sex = b.sex
WHERE a.user_id <> b.user_id;
```

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Top 5 Unique Job Titles

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT job_title
FROM cleaned_people_data
ORDER BY job_title ASC
LIMIT 5;
```
